Title,Abstract
Assistive technology in elderly care,"New developments in assistive technology are likely to make an important contribution to the care of elderly people in institutions and at home. Video‐monitoring, remote health monitoring, electronic sensors and equipment such as fall detectors, door monitors, bed alerts, pressure mats and smoke and heat alarms can improve older people's safety, security and ability to cope at home. Care at home is often preferable to patients and is usually less expensive for care providers than institutional alternatives."
Demographics and Trends in Wheeled Mobility Equipment Use and Accessibility in the Community,"This article presents a profile of household-resident U.S. adults using wheeled mobility equipment (WME) in 2005, trends in WME use from 1990 to 2005, and data on accessibility features and problems from 1994–97. Data were obtained from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) and the National Health Interview Survey on Disability (NHIS-D). Compared to the general population, WME users are more likely to be older, female, and in poor health. Forty-four percent are working-aged, with twice the rate of poverty of the general population, and only 17% are employed. Mobility difficulty is the most significant predictor of WME use, but gender, race, poverty, and educational attainment are also significant predictors. From 1990–2005, WME use grew 5% per year, while mobility difficulty declined among the elderly and remained steady among working-age persons. This contrast suggests a reduction in unmet need for WME. In 1994–97, more than half of WME users had difficulty entering or exiting their homes, and one-third had accessibility problems outside their homes. Usage of home modification was low, with substantial unmet need. Regular national data collection on the use of WME and other mobility aids, their financing, and accessibility issues is warranted."
"The right to assistive technology: for whom, for what, and by whom?","Despite its facilitating role in creating opportunities for people with disabilities to exercise human rights, access to assistive technology is limited in many countries. It is therefore promising that the Convention on Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) addresses this area. The purpose of this study was to analyse the assistive technology content of the CRPD from a basic human rights perspective in order to clarify its limitations and opportunities for formulation of policies and implementation strategies. Data were collected through a content analysis of the CRPD. It is concluded that a non‐discriminatory interpretation of the provisions entitles all people with disabilities to a right to demand available and affordable assistive technology. Ensuring this right is a national as well as an international responsibility."
Outcomes of assistive technology use on quality of life,"The results from many research efforts on the use of assistive devices are reviewed and summarized. Further, conceptual and methodological issues related to the use and abandonment of assistive technologies are discussed. Overall, this review should be helpful to professionals making device recommendations, documenting the need for a device, and assessing short- and long-term device utilization. The available literature lends support to a model of matching person and technology that considers environments of device use, characteristics of the user's preferences and expectations, and device features and functions. To ensure that assistive technologies enhance users' quality of life, future emphases should focus on consumer involvement in the selection and evaluation of appropriate assistive technology, and ways to make technologies more widely available and affordable."
Factors Associated With the Use of Standardized Power Mobility,"This study investigated self-reported prevalence of and factors affecting clinicians’ use of standardized assessments when evaluating clients for power mobility devices (PMDs), and explored assessments clinicians typically use when carrying out PMD evaluation. An e-mail survey was sent to assistive technology professionals listed in the Rehabilitation Engineering and Assistive Technology Society of North America directory. Three hundred fifty-four respondents, qualified to conduct formal power mobility skills assessments, completed the online survey. Of those, 122 (34.5%) respondents reported that they were aware of the presence of standardized performance-based power mobility skills assessments, but only 28 (7.9%) used these assessments in their practice. Multivariate analysis revealed that the odds of the respondents who use the standardized assessments were 18 times higher for those who were aware of the presence of these assessments than those who were not (adjusted odds ratio [OR] OR = 17.85, P < 0.0001). The odds of using the standardized assessment for respondents who did not identify themselves as occupational or physical therapists were five times higher than those who were therapists (adjusted OR = 0.20, P < 0.0001). This survey revealed that the assistive technology practitioners who recommend PMDs mainly use non-standardized mobility skills assessments."
Universal Design and Assistive Technology in Communication and Information Technologies: Alternatives or Complements?,"Universal design and assistive technology present advantages and disadvantages in accommodating the needs of people with disabilities. The best solution may be a combination of the two, using universal design wherever possible and commercially practical and using assistive technologies wherever it is necessary or provides sufficient additional advantage to the user. Three approaches are discussed for the individual who is unable to interact with their world: change the individual, provide them with tools they can use, or change the environment. Examples of each are illustrated using personal workstations and shared, public, and encountered systems. The final decision may rest on commercial practicality, and several new technologies are explored. Ultimately, we need to continue to move forward both on the universal design and the assistive technology fronts if we are to address the needs of people with disabilities and those who are aging."
The Design of an Interactive Assistive Kitchen System,"As the world's elderly population drastically increases, aging-related cognitive impairments have become one of the biggest healthcare concerns. In this paper, we present the design of an assistive kitchen system consisting of a user interface with two-way speech communication and an automated cabinet system to help promote aging-in-place. The assistive kitchen system incorporates a cognitive assistance feature that helps the user in overcoming initiation, planning, attention, and memory deficits, while performing kitchen-based activities of daily living (ADLs) such as storing and retrieving items, and obtaining recipes for meal preparation. This feature works synchronously with the automated kitchen cabinet to directly provide the location of an item to a user, bring the item in closer reach and also prompt the user to retrieve the item. An initial prototype of the assistive kitchen system has been developed and performance testing has been conducted. The testing has shown high success rates for users' retrieving and storing specified kitchen items. A small scale study was also conducted measuring the acceptance and use of the proposed system by older adults. The results show promise for the further development and use of the system for the outlined kitchen ADLs."
Managing Input During Assistive Technology Product Design,"Many different sources of input are available to assistive technology innovators during the course of designing products. However, there is little information on which ones may be most effective or how they may be efficiently utilized within the design process. The aim of this project was to compare how three types of input—from simulation tools, professional therapists, and end users—affect the final design when they are provided during the course of the design process. Eight design teams were recruited to independently design a working prototype of an assistive device while receiving a particular type of input. Twenty potential users were recruited to evaluate each of the devices with respect to effectiveness and satisfaction. The results indicate that in some cases each type of input can have a positive effect on end user evaluation. Issues related to how input may be affected by design concept selection, stakeholder recruitment, and timely delivery of input are discussed."
Assistive Technology for Individuals with Disabilities: A Review and Synthesis of the Literature,"Despite the emphasis on technology and the rapid proliferation of assistive technology devices, little is known about the specific uses of assistive technology with persons who vary in disability type, severity, and age. The present study conducted a comprehensive review and a systematic analysis of published reports of assistive technology and skill acquisition of persons with disabilities. Uses of assistive technology, its benefits and obstacles, are reviewed. The results provide indications why technology is often abandoned. Implications for practitioners and researchers are discussed."

A Survey of Assistive Technology Applications in Schools and Recommendations for Practice,"The Analysis of Technology Assistance for Children (ATAC) project was undertaken in recognition of the severe limit in information on current practices in field applications of assistive technology. Specifically, the ATAC project focused on investigating three problem areas: (1) the status of assistive technology in educational and related settings with school-age children with disabilities; (2) the benefits and barriers associated with using assistive technology for these youngsters; and (3) the effects of assistive technology use. A major aspect of the project involved a general survey of assistive technology use in special education classrooms across three states: Indiana, Kentucky, and Tennessee. This article presents the results of this effort, and discusses the implications in regard to improving practices in the field."
Assistive Technology Applications in Educational Programs of Children with Multiple Disabilities: A Case Study Report on the State of the Practice,"Results are reported of a two-year case study that analyzed how assistive technology was used in educational programs for 14 children with multiple disabilities who had two to ten years experience with assistive technology. The authors employed a modified longitudinal approach to study assistive technology use, the effects of technology applications, and barriers to the achievement of the children's educational goals. Data collection procedures included direct observation, videotapes of children as they used assistive technologies, questionnaires, and interviews with teachers and parents. In spite of a number of barriers, by the end of the study the children were able to use technology tools to accomplish tasks previously not possible due to the severity of their disabilities. The greatest improvement occurred in the areas of social and emotional development. The implications for assistive technology use by children with multiple disabilities are discussed."
The acceptability of assistive technology to older people,"Assistive technology (AT) is defined in this paper as ‘any device or system that allows an individual to perform a task that they would otherwise be unable to do, or increases the ease and safety with which the task can be performed’ (Cowan and Turner-Smith 1999). Its importance in contributing to older people's independence and autonomy is increasingly recognised, but there has been little research into the viability of extensive installations of AT. This paper focuses on the acceptability of AT to older people, and reports one component of a multi-disciplinary research project that examined the feasibility, acceptability, costs and outcomes of introducing AT into their homes. Sixty-seven people aged 70 or more years were interviewed in-depth during 2001 to find out about their use and experience of a wide range of assistive technologies. The findings suggest a complex model of acceptability, in which a ‘felt need’ for assistance combines with ‘product quality’. The paper concludes by considering the tensions that may arise in the delivery of acceptable assistive technology."
Computer vision for assistive technologies,"In the last decades there has been a tremendous increase in demand for Assistive Technologies (AT) useful to overcome functional limitations of individuals and to improve their quality of life. As a consequence, different research papers addressing the development of assistive technologies have appeared into the literature pushing the need to organize and categorize them taking into account the application assistive aims. Several surveys address the categorization problem for works concerning a specific need, hence giving the overview on the state of the art technologies supporting the related function for the individual. Unfortunately, this “user-need oriented” way of categorization considers each technology as a whole and then a deep and critical explanation of the technical knowledge used to build the operative tasks as well as a discussion on their cross-contextual applicability is completely missing making thus existing surveys unlikely to be technically inspiring for functional improvements and to explore new technological frontiers. To overcome this critical drawback, in this paper an original “task oriented” way to categorize the state of the art of the AT works has been introduced: it relies on the split of the final assistive goals into tasks that are then used as pointers to the works in literature in which each of them has been used as a component. In particular this paper concentrates on a set of cross-application Computer Vision tasks that are set as the pivots to establish a categorization of the AT already used to assist some of the user’s needs. For each task the paper analyzes the Computer Vision algorithms recently involved in the development of AT and, finally, it tries to catch a glimpse of the possible paths in the short and medium term that could allow a real improvement of the assistive outcomes. The potential impact on the assessment of AT considering users, medical, economical and social perspective is also addressed."
"Surveying Wearable Human Assistive Technology for Life and Safety Critical Applications: Standards, Challenges and Opportunities","In this survey a new application paradigm life and safety for critical operations and missions using wearable Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) technology is introduced. This paradigm has a vast scope of applications, including disaster management, worker safety in harsh environments such as roadside and building workers, mobile health monitoring, ambient assisted living and many more. It is often the case that during the critical operations and the target conditions, the existing infrastructure is either absent, damaged or overcrowded. In this context, it is envisioned that WBANs will enable the quick deployment of ad-hoc/on-the-fly communication networks to help save many lives and ensuring people's safety. However, to understand the applications more deeply and their specific characteristics and requirements, this survey presents a comprehensive study on the applications scenarios, their context and specific requirements. It explores details of the key enabling standards, existing state-of-the-art research studies, and projects to understand their limitations before realizing aforementioned applications. Application-specific challenges and issues are discussed comprehensively from various perspectives and future research and development directions are highlighted as an inspiration for new innovative solutions. To conclude, this survey opens up a good opportunity for companies and research centers to investigate old but still new problems, in the realm of wearable technologies, which are increasingly evolving and getting more and more attention recently."
"Non-use of provided assistive technology devices, a literature overview","Over the years, several studies have been performed on the subject of non-use of provided assistive technology. All of them report high rates of non-use. In this literature overview the determinants mentioned in literature that affect the degree of non-use will be discussed. They will be compared to the determinants that affect adherence with medical interventions. First, the various definitions of non-use used in literature will be compared. Next, an overview of the determinants of non-use of assistive technology will be given, categorized under personal factors, factors related to the assistive device, factors related to the user's environment and factors related to the intervention. After comparing these factors to the factors found in literature related to adherence with medical interventions, the strategies used to reduce non-adherence with medical interventions will be “translated” into the field of assistive technology provision."
