Title,Abstract
A review of the key challenges of non-fungible tokens,"The nonfungible token (NFT) marketplace spiked in the recent past. The concept originated initially as a token standard of Ethereum, an open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality, where each token is characterized by distinguishable signs. These types of tokens have unique digital properties that allow their distinct identification. NFTs, with their distinct qualities, can be fluidly traded with customized values according to their ages, rarity, and liquidity. The trading of NFTs has heavily influenced the growth of the decentralized application (dApp) marketplace, as exponential returns (thousand folds from their original value) on its ever-expanding market are being observed, leading to worldwide attention. However, the NFT ecosystem is in its nascence, and the associated technologies are still in their infancy. New researchers might be fascinated with the exponential, yet nebulous evolution of NFTs; however, this novelty has contributed to the paucity of systematic and conclusive published research work on this topic. This review portrays the NFT ecosystem multidimensionally, wherein the paper commences with an overview of state-of-the-art NFT technology and furnishes summary standards and desired properties. Finally, the study concludes with an elaborate discussion of the future outlook for and prime challenges faced by NFTs."
"Patents and intellectual property
assets as non‑fungible tokens; key
technologies and challenges","With the explosive development of decentralized fnance, we witness a phenomenal growth in
tokenization of all kinds of assets, including equity, funds, debt, and real estate. By taking advantage
of blockchain technology, digital assets are broadly grouped into fungible and non-fungible tokens
(NFT). Here non-fungible tokens refer to those with unique and non-substitutable properties.
NFT has widely attracted attention, and its protocols, standards, and applications are developing
exponentially. It has been successfully applied to digital fantasy artwork, games, collectibles, etc.
However, there is a lack of research in utilizing NFT in issues such as Intellectual Property. Applying
for a patent and trademark is not only a time-consuming and lengthy process but also costly. NFT has
considerable potential in the intellectual property domain. It can promote transparency and liquidity
and open the market to innovators who aim to commercialize their inventions efciently. The main
objective of this paper is to examine the requirements of presenting intellectual property assets,
specifcally patents, as NFTs. Hence, we ofer a layered conceptual NFT-based patent framework.
Furthermore, a series of open challenges about NFT-based patents and the possible future directions
are highlighted. The proposed framework provides fundamental elements and guidance for businesses
in taking advantage of NFTs in real-world problems such as grant patents, funding, biotechnology,
and so forth."
"Non-fungible token (NFT) markets on the Ethereum blockchain: temporal development, cointegration and interrelations","The market for non-fungible tokens (NFTs), transferrable and unique digital assets on public blockchains, has received widespread attention and experienced strong growth since early 2021. This study provides an introduction to NFTs and explores the 14 largest submarkets using data from the Ethereum blockchain between June 2017 and May 2021. The analyses rely on (a) the number of NFT sales, (b) the dollar volume of NFT trades and (c) the number of unique blockchain wallets that traded NFTs. Based on the number of transactions and wallets, the Ethereum-based NFT market peaked at the end of 2017 due to the success of the CryptoKitties project. As of 2021, fewer transactions occur but the traded value is much higher. We find that NFT submarkets are cointegrated and feature various causal short-run connections between them. The success or adoption of younger NFT projects is influenced by that of more established markets. At the same time, the success of newer markets has an impact on the more established projects. The results contribute to the overall understanding of the NFT phenomenon as an emerging asset class and suggest that NFT markets are immature or even inefficient."
Towards a secure and trustworthy imaging with non-fungible tokens,"Non fungible tokens (NFTs) are used to define the ownership of digital assets. More recently, there has been a surge of platforms to auction digital art as well as other digital assets in form of image, video, and audio content of all sorts. Although NFTs have the potential of revolutionizing the foundations of ownership, they also face various challenges notably in terms of trust and security. This paper starts by identifying the challenges in current NFTs and proposes a solution in order to remedy to their current shortcomings."
Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT). The Analysis of Risk and Return,"This study examines the risk and return characteristics of the NFT-based startups listed on the cryptocurrency exchange. Our investigation is motivated by the recent surge in the NFT activity on the part of creators, investors, and traders. We begin by proposing novel classification of the existing NFTs that range from NFT blockchains through NFT metaverse to NFT DeFi. Next, we establish that NFTs: 1) earn 130% on the first-listing-day; 2) yield an investment multiple of 40 (roughly 4,000%) over the long-term, which is four times higher than bitcoin during the same period; 3) deliver positive and significant alpha and exhibit above-average beta. We also show that the NFT segment of the cryptocurrency market leads market recovery following the mid-2021 crash and generate a return of close to 350%. In the final analysis of the paper, we find that NFT infrastructure integrated within the existing blockchains increase market valuations of these networks."
Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) – Innovation beyond the craze,"The COVID-19 pandemic has pushed digitalization
and digitization across all industry sectors and blockchain is
considered an innovative frontrunning technology with regards
to applicability and usability in these challenging times.
Blockchain technology has enabled access, through the process
of tokenization, to assets that, until now, could not be traded
quickly and easily. Tokenization is one of the cornerstones of
Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and a native functionality of
multiple blockchain architectures. The properties and features
of a token unlocks a variety of economic possibilities, besides the
main function of using it as fuel for the network itself.
A basic definition of a token refers to a digital asset that is
created, issued and managed on a Blockchain or Distributed
Ledger Technology (DLT) infrastructure, and is designed to be
highly secure with an instant transferability property. With the
advancement of smart contracts, some built-in functionalities
have been developed and programmed, which helped push the
tokenization process to new heights. From real estate security
tokens that represent fractionalized properties to platformspecific tokens that incentivize the use of a particular
application, tokens have emerged as a secure and digital
alternative for users across the world to access, trade and store
value.
The Content Creators and Art industry is going through a
paradigm shift with the introduction of Non-Fungible Tokens
(NFTs), as the space is acquiring a large number or artists
hoping to capitalize on the innovation and distribution power
that blockchain technology is offering. What digitization first
removed from art, blockchain is trying to bring it back,
reshaping the art world with viable tools for provenance,
authenticity and distribution.
In this paper we will assess the innovative approach of NFTs in
different sectors, with an in-depth analysis of their usability and
impact. We will be focusing on the features of NFTs to ensure
scarcity, traceability and proof of ownership, amongst the most
essential properties needed to create, store and maintain the
value of an asset. "
"Non-Fungible Token (NFT): Overview, Evaluation, Opportunities and Challenges","The Non-Fungible Token (NFT) market is mushrooming in recent years. The concept of NFT originally comes from a token standard of Ethereum, aiming to distinguish each token with distinguishable signs. This type of token can be bound with virtual/digital properties as their unique identifications. With NFTs, all marked properties can be freely traded with customized values according to their ages, rarity, liquidity, etc. It has greatly stimulated the prosperity of the decentralized application (DApp) market. At the time of writing (May 2021), the total money used on completed NFT sales has reached 34,530,649.86 USD. The thousandfold return on its increasing market draws huge attention worldwide. However, the development of the NFT ecosystem is still in its early stage, and the technologies of NFTs are pre-mature. Newcomers may get lost in their frenetic evolution due to the lack of systematic summaries. In this technical report, we explore the NFT ecosystems in several aspects. We start with an overview of state-of-the-art NFT solutions, then provide their technical components, protocols, standards, and desired proprieties. Afterward, we give a security evolution, with discussions on the perspectives of their design models, opportunities, and challenges. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic study on the current NFT ecosystems."
"Prospecting non-fungible tokens in the digital economy: Stakeholders and ecosystem, risk and opportunity","Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are a highly nascent and emerging phenomenon revolutionizing how digital assets are traded. NFTs embody immutable rights to unique digital assets such as digital art and collectibles and are represented as digital tokens that can be traded across marketplaces utilizing blockchain technologies. NFTs engender new ways to organize, consume, move, program, and store digital information and have experienced a rapid rise in various adaptations across art, sports, broadcasting, content creation, and tech-crypto businesses. In this article, we define NFTs and look at how they fit with blockchain and cryptocurrencies, how they are used by various industries, and the opportunities and risks they present. Our key contribution is a conceptual map of an initial NFT ecosystem. In doing so, we provide relational mapping between and among key stakeholders: content creators, core and related technical and business intermediaries, consumers, investors, and speculators. We also highlight implications for managers and tie them to conceptual exploration and exploitation frameworks."
"Non-Fungible Tokens: Blockchains, Scarcity, and Value","Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) have garnered remarkable investor attention recently, with some NFTs securing selling prices that may have seemed unthinkable for a non-fungible virtual asset. This raises fascinating questions about “value” and “scarcity” with respect to blockchain technology, through a prism of non-fungibility of a digital asset, and this paper aims to draw attention to these questions insofar as they may shape an alternative space of blockchain development and exchange going forward."
Secure Management of IoT Devices Based on Blockchain Non-fungible Tokens and Physical Unclonable Functions,"One of the most extended applications of blockchain technologies for the IoT ecosystem is the traceability of the data and operations generated and performed, respectively, by IoT devices. In this work, we propose a solution for secure management of IoT devices that participate in the blockchain with their own blockchain accounts (BCAs) so that the IoT devices themselves can sign transactions. Any blockchain participant (including IoT devices) can obtain and verify information not only about the actions or data they are taking but also about their manufacturers, managers (owners and approved), and users. Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs) based on the ERC-721 standard are proposed to manage IoT devices as unique and indivisible. The BCA of an IoT device, which is defined as an NFT attribute, is associated with the physical device since the secret seed from which the BCA is generated is not stored anywhere but a Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) inside the hardware of the device reconstructs it. The proposed solution is demonstrated and evaluated with a low-cost IoT device based on a Pycom Wipy 3.0 board, which uses the internal SRAM of the microcontroller ESP-32 as PUF. The operations it performs to reconstruct its BCA in Ethereum and to carry out transactions take a few tens of milliseconds. The smart contract programmed in Solidity and simulated in Remix requires low gas consumption."
"Crypto Collectibles, Museum Funding and OpenGLAM: Challenges, Opportunities and the Potential of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)","Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) make it technically possible for digital assets to be owned and traded, introducing the concept of scarcity in the digital realm for the first time. Resulting from this technical development, this paper asks the question, do they provide an opportunity for fundraising for galleries, libraries, archives and museums (GLAM), by selling ownership of digital copies of their collections? Although NFTs in their current format were first invented in 2017 as a means for game players to trade virtual goods, they reached the mainstream in 2021, when the auction house Christie’s held their first-ever sale exclusively for an NFT of a digital image, that was eventually sold for a record 69 million USD. The potential of NFTs to generate significant revenue for artists and museums by selling effectively a cryptographically signed copy of a digital image (similar to real-world limited editions, which are signed and numbered copies of a given artwork), has sparked the interest of the financially deprived museum and heritage sector with world-renowned institutions such as the Uffizi Gallery and the Hermitage Museum, having already employed NFTs in order to raise funds. Concerns surrounding the environmental impact of blockchain technology and the rise of malicious projects, exploiting previously digitised heritage content made available through OpenGLAM licensing, have attracted criticism over the speculative use of the technology. In this paper, we present the current state of affairs in relation to NFTs and the cultural heritage sector, identifying challenges, whilst highlighting opportunities that they create for revenue generation, in order to help address the ever-increasing financial challenges of galleries and museums."
The World of NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens): The Future of Blockchain and Asset Ownership,"Tokenizing assets through the use of blockchain is the next big thing in digital currency markets. Securing the assets in the world of the internet is challenging as most of them can easily be copied and sold in the secondary market. Protecting the rights of the asset owner is one of the challenging research areas. NFTs (non-fungible tokens) are very useful in representing the ownership of unique items for any assets. NFTs ensure that an asset can have only one official owner at any point in time with the help of Ethereum-based blockchain network. Ethereum NFTs can ensure that no one can modify the ownership rights or copy and paste the digital assets. NFTs are a boon to the artists, musicians, and others who want to create impressive digital assets. The objective of this chapter is to take you to the world of NFTs and to explain how the NFTs are going to impact digital transactions in a bigger way in the future. This chapter covers the introduction, technical aspects, security impacts, use cases, and successful implementations of NFTs in various realms."
Secure Combination of IoT and Blockchain by Physically Binding IoT Devices to Smart Non-Fungible Tokens Using PUFs,"Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are widely used in blockchain to represent unique and non-interchangeable assets. Current NFTs allow representing assets by a unique identifier, as a possession of an owner. The novelty introduced in this paper is the proposal of smart NFTs to represent IoT devices, which are physical smart assets. Hence, they are also identified as the utility of a user, they have a blockchain account (BCA) address to participate actively in the blockchain transactions, they can establish secure communication channels with owners and users, and they operate dynamically with several modes associated with their token states. A smart NFT is physically bound to its IoT device thanks to the use of a physical unclonable function (PUF) that allows recovering its private key and, then, its BCA address. The link between tokens and devices is difficult to break and can be traced during their lifetime, because devices execute a secure boot and carry out mutual authentication processes with new owners and users that could add new software. Hence, devices prove their trusted hardware and software. A whole demonstration of the proposal developed with ESP32-based IoT devices and Ethereum blockchain is presented, using the SRAM of the ESP32 microcontroller as the PUF."
A critical professional ethical analysis of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs),"Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) have quickly become an important part of the blockchain economy, theoretically representing ownership of a digital asset registered on a public blockchain such as Ethereum. While several applications of this technology exist, the key underlying factor in NFTs’ success is in their potential for investment – buying, selling, and trading the digital assets such as artwork or video game items using cryptocurrency. The rise and mid-2022 crash of NFT and associated crypto markets have shown the volatility of the sector, and questions have been raised around the sustainability, environmental impact, and exploitative practices within this space – and whether there are, in fact, any possible socially responsible use cases for NFTs. This paper aims to fill a gap in the literature surrounding NFTs, primarily through a thorough ethical analysis of the technology and its implementation, deployment, and sustainability. To do this, it uses the Association of Computing Machinery's Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct as a framework for analysis and, following this analysis, makes some recommendations for those wishing to investigate and/or implement NFTs in an ethically responsible manner. The key message is that unless there is absolutely no other way to solve a problem other than using NFTs, then they should not be implemented, as there is currently no ethical use case or means of implementation of NFTs."
"Privacy Laws, Genomic Data andNon-Fungible Tokens","This article analyses the main legal requirements in the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA), general data protection regulation
(GDPR) and the intersections between privacy laws, genomic data and smart contracts (such as fungible and non-fungible tokens
[NFTs]). The CCPA and GDPR laws impose several restrictions on the storing, accessing, processing and transferring of personal data.
This has generated some challenges for lawyers, data processors and business enterprises engaged in blockchain offerings, especially as
they pertain to high-risk data sets such as genomic data. The technical features of NFT, distributed storage and wallets to trace and
govern genomic (DNA) data sets will allow data donors to establish digital ownership and control in line with privacy laws using
‘programmable privacy smart contracts’. To be legally compliant, the design of blockchain value propositions should include privacy-bydesign capabilities in the smart contract coding language itself. This article describes three domains (privacy laws, genomics and NFTs)
and begins to explore how data engineers can address the challenges of coding privacy laws, the legal requirements into smart contracts.
This current approach focuses on NFTs and genomic data requirements which include the selection of genetic metadata borrowing
from developing ERC specifications and their programming logic. Programmable privacy is a unique way to write and design computer
code, which can automatically check the legal compliance of the smart contract in a trust-less and decentralised way. We exemplify the
approach by describing the conceptual value proposition of Genobank.io, a privacy-preserving genomic data platform."
